# Chikn Tinder: Enterprise Edition

The Chikn Tinder MVP was a smashing success! But it's time to scale up and out. We're tryna go to the moon and our little MVP just won't cut it anymore. It's time to take it to the next level with an enterprise-grade fullstack web application built with C#/.NET, React, ASP.NET Core, NHibernate, FluentMigrator, and MSSQL Server.

We will learn about n-Tier Architecture, the MVC pattern, Controller-Service-Repository pattern, Dependency Injection, Object-Relational Mapping, Database Migrations, Authentication/Authorization, and much more.
